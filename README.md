# scMORE_reproduce

scMORE (single cell MultiOmics Regulon Enrichment) is designed to identify disease-relevant regulons by leveraging GWAS summary statistics and multimodal single-cell measurements, where gene expression and chromatin accessibility are either measured for each individual cell or integrated into metacell or clusters to capture both modalities. Please find the scMORE R package in [Github] (https://github.com/mayunlong89/scMORE).

Here, we provide all scripts for analyzing and visualizing the ground-truth datasets and real single-cell multiomics data, along with numerous GWAS summary statistics on complex diseases.
